# Programming introduction

To start learning **C++** you'll have to use a *code editor*.

## Selecting a code editor

We recommend you to use an online code editor for the first few lessons. It will be easy and won't require any additional setup.

Recommended online C++ editors:

- [Repl.it](http://repl.it)

## Writing your first application

Open a code editor, then type the following code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, world!";
}
```

Congratulations! You've printed your first `Hello, World!`
