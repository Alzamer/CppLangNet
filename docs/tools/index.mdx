# Development tools

To program in C++ you need at least two tools:

- [a code editor](editors)
- [a compiler](compilers)

In brief:

- **a code editor** allows us to... edit the program code, manage the structure of files in the project
and usually has many other useful functions as well
- **a compiler** translates program code into a computer-understandable format <u>only</u> if the code is valid
ie. written according to the C++ language syntax

The combination of these two things into one tool is called **an IDE** (integrated development environment).

## Code editors

A summary of the available editors can be found in [Choose an editor](editors).

:::note
There you will also find environments with a built-in compiler (eg. Microsoft Visual Studio).

## Compilers

For a summary of the available compilers, see [Choose a compiler](compilers).
