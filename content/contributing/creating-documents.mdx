# Creating documents

import ImproveSection from "@site/i18n/en/presets/ImproveSection.mdx";

:::tip

Its highly recommended for you to first view many of already existing docs, to
learn by example.

:::

If you want to do so, please visit first our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3MeXQ8TvBw),
then ask if there's a need for such an article, or if the course edit would be reasonable.
You can do that or create an issue directly on GitHub, however the communication is
easier and faster on the Discord server.

Let's say that you want to write a lesson about class constructors.

First, make sure that you've created a English version of the document, even if you leave
it empty. **Pick a lowercase name without spaces, separated by hyphens**, for example:

```
class-constructors.mdx
```

Start by filling a [metadata of the document](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-frontmatter). Open it, and at the very top create a **document metadata** section.

```mdx
---
sidebar_position: 4
title: Class constructors
---
```

The `sidebar_position` field is **mandatory**.

For complete metadata list, please visit [this page](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-frontmatter).
