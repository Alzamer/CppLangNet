# First program

import Columns from '@site/src/components/mdx/Columns';
import NotFinished from '@site/i18n/en/presets/NotFinished.mdx';

<NotFinished/>

## Application code

We finished the previous lesson with the following code:


<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
Hello, World!
```

</div>
</Columns>

Which displays the text given above in the "Result" box.


## Explaination

### The main function

Let's start with the heart of our application, *the main function*

```cpp title="Part of main.cpp"
int main()
{

}
```

As we mentioned in the <a href="../index">introduction</a>, the computer runs the program line by line.
When it starts the application, it executes the instructions in the `main` code block sequentially.

A **code block** in C++, is a set of instructions contained inside curly braces:

```cpp
{

}
```

The function `main` has a block of code, and everything between the parentheses will be executed sequentially.

### The `iostream` library

At the very beginning of the code there is a line:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

It will allow us to continue using the input and output functions (hence `iostream` - from *input/output stream*).
In practice, this means that we will be able to write something in the console and let the user type something into the console and intercept it.
We'll tell more about `#include` itself in the future. Enough for the moment.

### Printing text to the console

We used this statement inside a `main` block:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!";
```

`cout` is the a **c**haracter **out**put stream, however, for the moment,
remember that it just displays the quoted text to the console.

If I now copy this line several times:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!1";
std::cout << "Hello, World!2";
std::cout << "Hello, World!3";
```

then I will get the following effect:

```
Hello, World!1Hello, World!2Hello, World!3
```

:::caution Semicolon at the end of instructions!
A semicolon (`;`) separates instructions. The compiler doesn't care about instructions being written on separate lines.
The semicolon is treated as the end of the statement. For this reason, such a code:
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!1"; std::cout << "Hello, World!2"; std::cout << "Hello, World!3";
```

it is **acceptable** but very illegible.
:::

### Prefix of the standard namespace

`std::` is the prefix of the **standard library** from which `cout` comes.

:::important Omiting the `std::` prefix

<details>
<summary>Expand the trivia</summary>
<div>

The prefix `std::` can be omitted if we give the appropriate line of code beforehand:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	using namespace std;
	cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```
However, many experienced programmers recommend writing `std::`.

### For the curious (those more advanced)

The standard library is very extensive, it has a lot of names used.
Using `using namespace std;` unpacks all these names to the global namespace.
which may be surprising if we want to use names like `left`,` right`, `precision`, etc.

Using `using namespace std;` elsewhere than locally inside a function code block
is considered **bad programming practice** and is strongly discouraged.

## Performing calculations

Programming is used to automate certain activities.
For example, we can have a computer do a mathematical calculation for us.

Use the following code:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '5fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "120 * 120 + 540";
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
120 * 120 + 540
```

</div>
</Columns>

Pay attention to the result of the above program.

:::caution
Everything in quotation marks is treated as text, not instructions.
:::

Therefore, instead of displaying the result of the calculation,
we got what we entered in the quotation marks.

To say that we want to perform some calculation, we need to remove the quotes:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '5fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << 120 * 120 + 540;
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
14940
```

</div>
</Columns>

After starting the program, we will get the correct result of the calculation in the code.

:::important Mathematical operators
- `+` adds two numbers together
- `-` subtracts two numbers from each other
- `*` multiplies two numbers by itself
- `/` divides two numbers by itself
