# Variables

import Columns from '@site-comps/Columns'
import NotFinished from '@site/i18n/en/presets/NotFinished.mdx';

<NotFinished/>

In the previous lesson, we talked about automation and showed you how to do some calculations.

## What is it for?

Let's write a program that raises a certain number to the power of three and then displays it:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['8fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp | Power of three"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << 212 * 212 * 212;
}
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
9528128
```

</div>
</Columns>

If we now want to raise a different number to the third power, we will have
to change three places in the code. It is tedious.

## Variables come to the rescue

In order not to change so many things every time, let's assume for a moment
that the number we are raising to the power of three is called `x`.
What will the code look like then?

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << x * x * x;
}
```

The above program at this stage **will not compile**. To use `x` in a calculation,
we first need to create a **variable** named `x`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	int x = 212;
	std::cout << x * x * x;
}
```

The above program will compile and run correctly.
