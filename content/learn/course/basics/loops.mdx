# Loops

In this lesson, we'll make the program execute a given code multiple times, that is, we'll use a loop.

## Motivation

Loops have many uses, here are a few of them:

- ðŸ‘¾ adding, for example, 10 new opponents to the level in the game
- ðŸ–¥ displaying each element in an array
- âž— multiple calculations (e.g. counting factorials, fibonacci sequence)

In the vector lesson, we already showed one loop that displayed
all the elements of an array:

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Print each number from an array"
for (int n : numbers)
{
	std::cout << n << ' ';
}
```

This is the simplest version of a loop in C++.
You will learn more about their types in the following sections.

## Loop types

- **`for`**
	- range-based version
	- basic version
- **`while`**
- **`do ... while`**

The most common used are `for` and `while`, and we'll cover them in this lesson.
If you want to read about the `do ... while` loop, see the article:
[**`do ... while` loop**](articles/do-while).

## Explaination

### Range-based for

This type of loop is most commonly used for working with arrays,
although it can also be used in other ways.

In the example shown in the [**Motivation**](#motivation) section, there is a **range-based for** loop,
which is a version of the `for` loop for the so-called ranges.

An array as understood in C++ is also a range, so feel free to use it.

The simplest example:

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Print each number from an array"
std::vector<int> numbers = { 13, 42, -1, 0, -3, -5 };

for (int n : numbers)
{
	std::cout << n << ' ';
}
```

This loop sequentially traverses each element of the array `numbers` and writes it to the
variable `n`. The block of code enclosed in the curly braces is then executed.
In this case it is a simple printing of the number.

:::caution Colon
Note that the variable name `n` is followed by **a colon (`:`), not a semicolon (`;`)**!
We do not use any equal sign (`=`) in this notation, because the value of each element in turn
will be automatically assigned to `n`.

## `while` loop

<Image center border maxheight="300px"
		src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/loops/while-en.png"
		alt="'while' loop scheme"
		desc="Scheme"
	/>
<br/>

We are now intentionally moving into the `while` loop, rather than the basic `for`,
as this will make the explanation easier. The while loop is simple.
It executes the body of the loop until the condition is true:

<Columns columns={['8fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Print numbers from 0 to 3"
int number = 0;
while (number <= 3)
{
	std::cout << number << ' ';
	number++;
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
0 1 2 3
```

</div>
</Columns>

The condition will be checked **before** each loop execution and as long as it is satisfied,
i.e. as long as `number` is less than or equal to `3` in this case, the body will be executed.

- printing the `number`
- increasing `number` by 1

After the last loop execution, the value of `number` will be equal to `4`,
so the condition will not be satisfied, causing the loop to terminate and the computer
to proceed with the next instructions.
